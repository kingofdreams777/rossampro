                            My journey as a software engineer and web developer has been
                            a long one. In High School I took Computer Science Classes
                            and I was genuinely interested in them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We learned about Python, and PyGame, and Scratch and all of
                            those basic languages/concepts to keep iPad babies interested in
                            complex things. I was certainly interested in different things:
                        </p>

                            video games primarily
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            My biggest concern at the time was how good I was at
                            Call of Duty Black Ops. Times were certainly simpler,
                            and I had no idea what the impact of those classes were
                            going to be going into my college years and then, <i>ultimately</i>,
                            my career.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the summer between high school and college, I had
                            my fair amount of fun and also took part in my fair share
                            of binge watching old sitcoms on Netflix. My Sitcom of
                            choice at that time was
                            <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285403/" class="link link-hover link-primary">Scrubs</a>.
                            Scrubs was such a guilty pleasure of mine and I got super
                            deep into it, watching it non-stop. At the time, I thought
                            that what I wanted to do was to study to become a doctor.

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Ultimately, throughout college and my journey I decided
                            that becoming a Doctor/Surgeon wasn't the best decision
                            for me. I was discovering my love for music and music
                            creation and started to form a band with some of my classmates.
                            Our band, Essex Class, did well and play more shows than
                            I can count. We even got approached by a record label but
                            ended up not going with them because they're contract was
                            pretty poor in my opinion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That band <i>like most</i> broke up and I began to discover
                            my own solo music sound, a mix of rock and electronic
                            music somewhat reminiscient of Daft Punk but with a bit
                            more Maroon 5 in the mix.

                            Graduating from College I dove into the San Diego music
                            scene and explored all of the opportunities there. Alternate
                            Era was doing well, playing shows just about every single
                            day wherever we could manage. Our music was new, strange,
                            and perked a lot of ears from those who bore witness to
                            our sound and our stage show. Combining tracks with a
                            drummer and having two singers/rappers on stage made for
                            a high energy show unlike any other in San Diego at the

                        <p>
                            Like a call from God, I was reminded of my time
                            in high school learning programming and remembered
                            the joy I had solving those puzzles. I felt that
                            maybe that would be my escape, my pathway forward

                        <p>
                            So I worked. I treated learning to program like a
                            full time job and each day at 8 A.M. I would start
                            up my computer, logon to Codecademy and continue
                            about my Web Developer learning path. It was a lot
                            of hard work and I still had so much to learn.

                        <p>
                            I continued on like this during the pandemic up until
                            I got hired at my current company as a Data Analyst.
                            Before my intro to Software Engineering Professionally
                            I had a background in Data Analysis, and used Python
                            to enhance those Data analysis skills.

                        <p>
                            I applied for a Software Engineer position internally
                            at my company and moved through the hiring process.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Screening call with the recruiter <i>Great</i>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Screening call with the hiring manager <i>Fantastic</i>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        People saw my passion and motivation to improve and
                        ended up rooting for my success
