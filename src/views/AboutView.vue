                        My journey as a software engineer and web developer has been
                        a long one. In High School I took Computer Science Classes
                        and I was genuinely interested in them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We learned about Python, and PyGame, and Scratch and all of
                        those basic languages/concepts to keep iPad babies interested in
                        complex things. I was certainly interested in different things:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>

                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        My biggest concern at the time was how good I was at
                        Call of Duty Black Ops. Times were certainly simpler,
                        and I had no idea what the impact of those classes were
                        going to be going into my college years and then, <i>ultimately</i>,
                        my career.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the summer between high school and college, I had
                        my fair amount of fun and also took part in my fair share
                        of binge watching old sitcoms on Netflix. My Sitcom of
                        choice at that time was
                        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285403/" class="link link-hover link-primary">Scrubs</a>.
                        Scrubs was such a guilty pleasure of mine and I got super
                        deep into it, watching it non-stop. At the time, I thought
                        that what I wanted to do was to study to become a doctor.

                <div>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately, throughout college and my journey I decided
                        that becoming a Doctor/Surgeon wasn't the best decision
                        for me. I was discovering my love for music and music
                        creation and started to form a band with some of my classmates.
                        Our band, Essex Class, did well and play more shows than
                        I can count. We even got approached by a record label but
                        ended up not going with them because they're contract was
                        pretty poor in my opinion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That band <i>like most</i> broke up and I began to discover
                        my own solo music sound, a mix of rock and electronic
                        music somewhat reminiscient of Daft Punk but with a bit
                        more Maroon 5 in the mix.

                        My solo music brought me to discovering my love for hip
                        hop when I partnered up with an old high school friend
                        of mine named Chris Lockhart. Chris and I had always
                        just played Super Smash Bros together until one day we
                        started making music together.

                        Our band, Alternate Era was a powerhouse of a music group
                        getting compared to such greats as Linkin Park, Rage Against
                        the Machine and others along that Rap/Rock list of bands.
                        I miss working with him, as he moved to New York shortly
                        before my life changed forever.

                        Graduating from College I dove into the San Diego music
                        scene and explored all of the opportunities there. Alternate
                        Era was doing well, playing shows just about every single
                        day wherever we could manage. Our music was new, strange,
                        and perked a lot of ears from those who bore witness to
                        our sound and our stage show. Combining tracks with a
                        drummer and having two singers/rappers on stage made for
                        a high energy show unlike any other in San Diego at the
                        time.

                        2021 brought its own string of novelty for me to handle
                        when my girlfriend at the time got pregant and things
                        rapidly changed.

                        A surprise like a child can leave anyone wondering what
                        to do in their situation, but I knew that the only thing
                        that could keep me going was to take responsibility for
                        what I could control. And I knew that I needed to improve
                        my current career situation.
